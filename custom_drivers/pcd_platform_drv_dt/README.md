# Pseudo Char Platform Driver Using Device Tree

You will need to have access to a linux kernel repository and U-Boot repository for testing this driver. For this example I will use this versions:
| Software               | Version        |
|:----------------------:|:--------------:|
| u-boot                 | v2019.04       |
| linux                  | 5.4.106+       |
| gcc-linaro-gnueabihf   | 6.4.1-2017.11  |

## Testing Process
- Place the [am335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi](am335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi) into the linux kernel repository, in /arch/arm/boot/dts folder.
- Include the file in am335x-boneblack.dts adding ```#include "am335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi"```.
- Compile for generating the am335x-boneblack.dtb file using:
```console
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
```
- Place this file in the BOOT partition of your device (i.e. in the BOOT partiton of the uSD card).
- Compile the platform driver:
```console
make all
```
- Place the generated kernel object into the Beaglebone Black, i.e. using scp command:
```console
scp *.ko debian@192.168.7.2:/home/debian/drivers
```
- Connect to the Beaglebone Black opening a terminal (i.e. minicom) and install the module using ```Ã¬nsmod```.
