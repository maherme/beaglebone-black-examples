# Pseudo Char Platform Driver Using Device Tree
This is a similar driver to [pcd_platform_drv](../pcd_platform_drv), but here I am using the device tree for abstracting some features of the driver as the serial number, the memory size and the permissions of each device. You can find the details in the [arm335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi](arm335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi) file:
|                    | pcdev-0      | pcdev-1      | pcdev-2      | pcdev-3      |
|:------------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Size (bytes)       | 512          | 1024         | 256          | 2048         |
| Serial Number      | PCDEV1ABC123 | PCDEV2ABC456 | PCDEV3ABC789 | PCDEV4ABC000 |
| Access Permissions | RDWR         | RDWR         | RDWR         | RDWR         |

The binding between the nodes in the dtsi file and the driver is done using a compatibility struct, in the example is this:
```c
struct of_device_id org_pcdev_dt_match[] = {
    {.compatible = "pcdev-A1x", .data = (void*)PCDEVA1X},
    {.compatible = "pcdev-B1x", .data = (void*)PCDEVB1X},
    {.compatible = "pcdev-C1x", .data = (void*)PCDEVC1X},
    {.compatible = "pcdev-D1x", .data = (void*)PCDEVD1X},
    {}
};
```

So if a node in the dtsi has a compatible field which matches with one in the of_device_id struct, the probe function is called.

This struct needs to be included in the platform driver struct in order to be used by the kernel:
```c
struct platform_driver pcd_platform_driver = {
    .probe = pcd_platform_driver_probe,
    .remove = pcd_platform_driver_remove,
    .id_table = pcdevs_ids,
    .driver = {
        .name = "pseudo-char-device",
        .of_match_table = of_match_ptr(org_pcdev_dt_match)
    }
};
```

For a deep diving in the binding process you can explore the [platform_match](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/base/platform.c#L1335) function in the kernel, placed in drivers/base/platform.c file.

You will need to have access to a linux kernel repository and U-Boot repository for testing this driver. For this example I will use this versions:
| Software               | Version        |
|:----------------------:|:--------------:|
| u-boot                 | v2019.04       |
| linux                  | 5.4.106+       |
| gcc-linaro-gnueabihf   | 6.4.1-2017.11  |

## Testing Process
- Place the [am335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi](am335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi) into the linux kernel repository, in /arch/arm/boot/dts folder.
- Include the file in am335x-boneblack.dts adding ```#include "am335x-boneblack-pcd.dtsi"```.
- Compile for generating the Device Tree Blob file (am335x-boneblack.dtb) using (you need to execute this command in the linux kernel root directory):
```console
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- am335x-boneblack.dtb
```
- Place this file in the BOOT partition of your device (i.e. in the BOOT partiton of the uSD card).
- Compile the platform driver:
```console
make all
```
- Place the generated kernel object into the Beaglebone Black, i.e. using scp command:
```console
scp *.ko debian@192.168.7.2:/home/debian/drivers
```
- Connect to the Beaglebone Black opening a terminal (i.e. minicom) and reboot it.
- After the reboot you can watch the devices detected in /sys/devices/platform directory.
- You can load the generated kernel modules using ```Ã¬nsmod```, the probe function will be executed 4 times.
